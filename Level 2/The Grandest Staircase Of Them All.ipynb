    "With the LAMBCHOP doomsday device finished, Commander Lambda is preparing to debut on the galactic stage -- but in order to make a grand entrance, Lambda needs a grand staircase! As the Commander's personal assistant, you've been tasked with figuring out how to build the best staircase EVER.<br>\n",

    "Lambda has given you an overview of the types of bricks available, plus a budget. You can buy different amounts of the different types of bricks (for example, 3 little pink bricks, or 5 blue lace bricks). Commander Lambda wants to know how many different types of staircases can be built with each amount of bricks, so they can pick the one with the most options. <br>\n",
