# Google FooBar
This repository has detailed explanation and codes of my journey through Google's FooBar challenge to destroy Commander Lambda's evil organization.

## Structure
Each folder has the problems and detailed solution and sample test cases as I progress through multiple phases of my strategy to weaken Commander Lambda.

## Current Status
I was able to progress through 4 levels of my plan. Lambda's space station is exploding. But now, he is chasing me in a heavily-armed starfighter, while you and the bunny workers are stuck in these lumbering escape pods.
